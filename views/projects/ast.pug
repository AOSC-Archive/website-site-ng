        # What?

        AST's Startup Toolkit is a helper for installing AOSC OS and other Linux
        distributions on Windows. AST's Startup Toolkit was originally known as
        "Anthon Starter", providing support for installing AOSC OS (formerly
        AnthonOS) on Windows.

        # Current status

        Anthon Starter, after several attempts of development, have failed.
        However, the project has restarted its development design process, to remake
        the project into a universal installer instead of one that serves
        AOSC OS specifically.

        # Get in touch

        Currently several people are participating in the re-design effort, however,
        currently it is better to get in touch with Junde Yhi <lmy441900@aosc.xyz>
        to have some initial interaction before you join.
