        ## Early Days

        AOSC, short for Anthon Open Source Community, is a F/OSS focused
        community first established by Mingcong (Jeff) Bai and his classmates
        in 2011, initially with an intention to create a more easy-to-use Linux
        distribution with better CJK language support, they started the AnthonOS
        (later known as AOSC OS) project - the first, and still the largest
        project of the community.

        The community was never in its structure like what it is today before
        the end of year 2012, when the community was structured like a corporate
        development team. The community was formed from the nearly schattered
        team named "Anthon.Dev", due to lack of a common goal and severely
        bureaucratic system of members.

        Forming a community, AOSC began to include projects other than AOSC OS
        itself - started and maintained by community members. First of which
        being the Anthon Starter (later AST's Startup Toolkit) for installing
        AOSC OS from Windows.

        ## Our common goal

        AOSC's one and only pursuit is for the advancement of open technologies
        that benefits technology users like us who work for the community, and
        you who enjoys results from our effort.

        ## How we work

        We do not endorse or suggest any form of physical or finanical income
        or reward for our own work. We believe that volunteered work and
        deliberate contribution is the most effective form for our community's
        sustainability.

        ## What we disapprove

        As a technology-based community, we disapprove any form of:

        - Unscientific or unprofessional behaviors in development work;
        - Unethical use of other's work, including those protected under terms
        of commercial licenses;
        - Political discussion in any of our mailing list and chatting groups;
        - Discrimination of any kind against individuals of different political,
        social, and racial standpoints;
