  I am a mixins header file designed for:
    simplifying tags to some little mixins.

  My mixins' prototype:

    +include-css(url)

    +include-js(url)

mixin include-css(url)
  link(rel="stylesheet", href="https://aosc-www.anthonos.org" + url)

mixin include-js(url)
  script(src="https://aosc-www.anthonos.org" + url)
