doctype html
//-
  I am the HTML framework for the whole website.
  
  My blocks for extending:
    
    variables (optional)
      Usage: append
      * This block helps extender to change some variables in this template,
      * and also to define some constants in a elegant way.
    
    head-global (protected)
      Usage: any
      * This may be HARDLY changed. It defined global characteristics
      * with meta mixins.
    
    head-custom
      Usage: OVERRIDE
      * You MUST override this block to explicitly define what the title is
      * and what the keywords are.
    
    stylesheet (optional)
      Usage: append
      * This defined CSS to load by default. You SHOULD only place (append)
      * stylesheets in here.
    
    javascript-prior (optional)
      Usage: append
      * This defined Javascript to run prior. Generally, it SHOULD be
      * lightweight so that page content can be loaded and shown as early
      * as possible.
    
    body
      Usage: OVERRIDE
      * You've known.
    
    javascript (optional)
      Usage: append
      * This defined most of the Javascript, so that you SHOULD place (append)
      * Javascript in here normally.
