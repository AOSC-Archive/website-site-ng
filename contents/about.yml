      AOSC's most extensive project is the Linux distribution project, "AOSC OS".
      However, the community is not merely just a group of people working on the
      distribution project. We have many other projects, big or small, hosted and
      contributed by members of the community.

      A good example would be the L10n - or "localization" - project, the AOSC L10n
      projects holds localization improvements, bug fixes for various F/OSS projects.
      These fixes will not just benefit AOSC OS itself, all the contributed or improved
      localization work will be pushed back onto the upstream, making every user of
      the software easier when using with his/her first language.
