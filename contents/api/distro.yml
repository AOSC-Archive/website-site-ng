    - name: KDE
      description: |
        KDE (Plasma Desktop) provides an extensive set of functionality with
        virtually unlimited amount of customizable settings, and comes complete
        with an elegant interface. With a strong set of utilities, games,
        and tools, KDE is quite suitable for day-to-day desktop computing
        with a refreshing sense of aesthetic.
    - name: GNOME
      description: |
        GNOME is a desktop environment with a strong emphasis on human
        interactivity, multilingual support, and accessibility. Designed as
        a desktop for humanity, GNOME provides users with a minimal yet elegant
        interface for those who may understand its innovative logic in desktop
        computing.
    - name: MATE
      description: |
        MATE is a desktop environment that sticks to the traditions - in which
        the developers of this particular desktop environment believe. Being a
        fork of GNOME 2, MATE never has been a desktop of the past during its
        development history. MATE continuously updates itself to the newest
        technologies while tries its best to provide users with a familiar
        desktop experience.
    - name: XFCE
      description: |
        XFCE, like its logo, is a quick and smart little rat on your desktop.
        This is a desktop with rich customizability, responsive interface, and
        a small footprint. XFCE can run very quick even on older machines while
        providing a complete desktop experience, making it a near perfect choice
        for performance constrained devices.
    - name: Base
      description: |
        While AOSC OS focuses itself in providing complete and refined desktop
        experience in all other variants, we understand that there are
        those who prefers all choices remained on their hands. The Base
        variant provides a minimal set of features, just enough for you to get
        started. Base is still a pre-configured variant - like AOSC OS should
        be - this is also suitable for performance constrained devices like say,
        a Raspberry Pi board; or simply drop it on your server and go from there.
