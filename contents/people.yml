  longdesc: >
    Artoria’s lack of focus has dragged AOSC into upstreaming much more than code.
    A terrible feline being herself, Artoria usually pokes at something, and then
    leaves it for everyone else at AOSC. Her curiosity hasn’t killed herself yet.
    (We are buffled by the fact that Artoria, as a cat, enjoys drinking Coffiest
    for breakfast: cats are not supposed to consume caffeine.) According to Artoria,
    drawing SVGs, participating in “electronic activism”, setting up weird rules,
    and reinventing wheels is much more interesting than doing real work.

    It is this misaka's shame of laziness that
    hardly did this misaka work for AOSC or other
    parts of the whole free software community.
    This misaka now realizes that a parasite of society
    still has the right to change and start to do three
    little things for the community. This misaka will
    begin to fulfill its repo, let us wait and see.
