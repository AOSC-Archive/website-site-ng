## TODO

The website is far from being finished and ready to put in production. Here's
what's left to do.

### Higher priority

~~- A distribution download page ("AOSC OS downloads");~~
- Links to GitHub, Downloads on the "Projects" page;
- Support for linking to specific news entry on both "index" and "news-flow";
- Fix dummy links;
- Fix styles on various pages, especially "about";
- "about" needs icons for various ways of contact;

### Lower priority

- Multi-language support;
- A banner background, if needed;
- "Night mode", a different set of color set, and style for late-at-night browsing;
