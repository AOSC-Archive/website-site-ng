    title: Data corruption on software RAID 0 when discard is used
    content:
      - >
        Recent Linux kernels (4.0.2+, LTS 3.14.41+), pushed to the [core]
        repository in the past couple of weeks, suffered from a bug that
        can cause data corruption on file systems mounted with the _discard_
        option and residing on software RAID 0 arrays. Even if _discard_ is not
        specified, the fstrim command can also trigger this bug. (**If you do
        not use software RAID 0 or the _discard_ option, then this issue does
        not affect you.**)
      - >
        The issue has been addressed in the linux 4.0.4-2 and linux-lts
        3.14.43-2 updates. Due to the nature of the bug, however, it is likely
        that data corruption has already occurred on systems running the
        aforementioned kernels. It is strongly advised to verify the integrity
        of affected file systems using fsck and/or restore their data from
        known good backups

        [LKML post](https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/5/21/167) by Holger Kiehl,
        the related article on Phoronix, as well as the proposed fix that was
        backported to the Arch kernels.

    title: Puppet 4.0 enters [community]
    content:
      - >
        Puppet 4 has been released and breaks compatibility with version 3.
        Therefore users will need to upgrade a server to Puppet 4 before
        updating their clients. Note that if only a Puppet 4 server is available,
        Puppet 3 clients will not work. Also a number of locations for things
        have changed including the config, manifest and module files. You will
        need to follow upgrade instructions for your servers and clients:
