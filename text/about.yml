      Anthon Open Source Community originated as a small school based
      development team in November of 2011, with only three members (and just
      one of them as the developer). It used to be named after "Anthon.Dev",
      or Anthon Developers.
    - >
      The community was established one year later, and was therefore named as
      "Anthon Open Source Community"; The community was established in a wish
      to open up opportunities for new projects to join, and a more equal system
      that open source developers will like to work in.
    - >
      Many projects are started, ended, forked, ... you name it, after the
      establishment of the community.
